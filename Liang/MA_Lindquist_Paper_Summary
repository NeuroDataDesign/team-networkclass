Summary of Comparing test-retest reliability of dynamic functional connectivity methods

Commonly used estimation methods for dynamic connectivity:
	Sliding window(SW)
	Tapered sliding window(TSW)
	Dynamic conditional correlation(DCC): parametric model-based method that estimates conditional variances and correlations

Two categories of dynamic FC summary measures:
	Mean and variance of dynamic functional connectivity
	Brain states(recurring whole-brain patterns of FC)
	
Datasets: Kirby Data, HCP Data
Reliability evaluation: ICC, I2C2

Conclusions:
1. The reliability of dynamic correlation means was highly consistent across all estimation methods(for both datasets)
2. Variances of dynamic correlations estimated using the DCC method displayed the highest reliability(for both datasets)
3. Across all estimation methods, reliability of the brain state-derived measures was low

Plans for the next step:
Consider using DCC methods combined with the mean & variance of dynamic FC as estimates, evaluate discriminability
