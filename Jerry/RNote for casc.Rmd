This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
# A Simple Test of CASC
```{r}
library(SpecClustPack)
blockPMat = matrix(c(.6,.2,.2,.6), nrow=2)
nMembers = c(5,5)

adjMat = simSBM(blockPMat, nMembers)
adjMat
covProbMat = matrix(c(.8,.2,.2,.8), nrow=2)
nMembers = c(5,5)

covMat = simBernCovar(covProbMat, nMembers)
covMat
casc(adjMat, covMat, nBlocks=2)
```
