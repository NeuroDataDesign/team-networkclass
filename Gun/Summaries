GraSPy: Graph Statistics in Python (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05329)
arXiv, J.Chung et al. 

GraSPy was made to work with random graphs/populations of graphs, and analyze them with a statistical 
approach. 
Existing functions can perform preprocessing on graphs. The paper specifically gives examples of
connectome model fitting in Figure 2. Graphs can be visualized as adjacency matrices. (Ask about 
embedded graphs). 


Network Classification with Applications to Brain Connectomics (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08140)
arXiv, J.Arroyo et al. 

Section 1:
Networks can be created from the brain by forming weighted connections, representing correlating activity, 
between nodes, representing brain regions. This paper in particular focuses on functional connectivity, 
as indicated by correlations in BOLD signal. 
Connectivity is measured for every pair of nodes, forming an nxn adjacency matrix. For the datasets used, 
their sizes make some approaches non-viable. As a result, one may approach analysis by first reducing
the network to certain global features, but will ignore local differences as a result. 
The other approach focuses on local features, but forgoes the analysis of global structure.
