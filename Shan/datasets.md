***HCP_S1200_GroupAvg_v1 Dataset*** (1096, 1003, 812 and 997 Subjects):

    * maps for all 1096 individual subjects enable efficient between subjects comparisons of folding, ‘sulc’, myelin, and thickness data; With group-average structural and functional MRI data for the final HCP S1200 data release, including group average volumes, structural maps, Cohen's D effect-size maps for task contrasts, and links for viewing seed-based dense functional connectivity;

    * Group Average Functional Connectivity (1003 and 812 Subjects): complete rfMRI data (recons r177 and r227) from 1003 subjects, and a subset of 812 of these subjects whose fMRI data was reconstructed using the improved r227 recon algorithm;

    * HCP1200 Parcellation + Timeseries + Netmats (1003 Subjects): complete rfMRI data (4800 timepoints, recon 177 + r227) from 1003 subjects, yielding the following outputs at 6 ICA dimensionalities;

    * Netmats Megatrawl (820 Subjects): An analysis of the relationships between imaging and non-imaging measures in HCP S900 subjects, using multivariate-prediction and univariate-regression.
