# Summary
Connectal Coding: Discovering the Structures Linking Cognitive Phenotypes to Individual Histories, JT Vogelstein et. al

## Abstract
* connectal coding identifies netwrok structures that link congition to individual history
* brain structure can be simply and usefully modelled by a network of nodes and edges
* goal of brain connectivity modeling is to link connectivity patterns to events

## Modeling Brain as network
* a connectome is a mathematical model of the brain (denoted G), contained nodes and edges
  * nodes represent an entity of the brain. Contraints are set on nodes, such as spatial contraint, resolution, and type
  * edges represent the presence of a connection between these nodes.
* It is common to represent this network as a graph, using the adjacency matrix
* Structure is further added to these networks through edge weights

## Example Estimated Connectomes
* connectomes visualized using the adjacency matrix
* nodes were sorted by order or type
* in the connectome matrix, color intensity corresponds to the degree of connectivity between two regions

## The purpose of brain codes
* the neural activity codes correspond to how the brain represents information
* however, connectal coding corresponds to how the brain stores information
* both activity and connectal codes are stochastic. This property is "required for operating in the world"
