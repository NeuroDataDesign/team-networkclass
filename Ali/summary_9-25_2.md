# Summary: Network Classification with Applications to Brain Connectomics (6,7)
JD Arrayo-Relion et al.

## 6. Application to Schizophrenia data
* how does the classifier perform on the brain fMRI data?
* accuracy generally decreases as the solution becomes sparser, which is common in high-dimensional settings 
* most methods performed better on the COBRE dataset than on the UMich dataset.
* which can be explained by the different sample sizes and possibly noise levels.
* the COBRE dataset is also more homogeneous.
* the method performed very well on both datasets
* for the Cobre data, good accuracy can be achieved with small number of edges, and the noisier UMich
data requires more edges. 

## Discussion
* the method presented is unique in that it selects a sparse set of both edges and vertices..
* regularization is convex, making the method computationally efficient
* results: able to predict disease status accurately by using on sets as training and other as testing.
